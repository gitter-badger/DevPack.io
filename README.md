DevPack is a solution where it makes you're ideal developer environment/environment's accessible anywhere and anytime. Inspired by the Ninite, the one click install solution, I could not find a solution in which I could just install everything and have all my configurations stored. So I got inspired to solve this problem and thought what if their was something to save my own dev enviorment. Thats when I got the idea for DevPack.io.

(Note this is a work in progress so I am not 100% of how this will work yet. I made this repo so people can post their ideas on the issues board.)
